        <p>The Versions Server allows you to manage the latest version for your Elgg plugins.</p>
	    <p>It records the version number, used by the Version Check plugin to notify admins of any updates and new releases.</p>
	    <p>It also requires the Elgg Download GUID from the Elgg community site. This is the last part of the download URL for the version in question. It is a number, and it is needed to redirect downloads of your plugins handled from this site to the very latest version.</p>
	    <p>Finally, a very short description of the features of the new version is required and is provided to the admins that use the Version Check plugin.</p>
